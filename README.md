## üåê Why GPTRouter?

At Writesonic, after three years of navigating the world of large language models, we identified key challenges and built GPTRouter to solve them.

### Solving Real-World Challenges:

1. **Model Independence**: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. GPTRouter lets you break free from the limitations of relying on just one AI model like OpenAI. If one model is down, GPTRouter keeps you up and running by seamlessly switching to another.

2. **Beat the Latency**: Slow response times? Not anymore. GPTRouter is designed to tackle latency issues, especially with hefty models like GPT-4. Experience a smoother, faster user interaction without delays.

3. **Diverse Model Integration**: Why settle for one when you can have more? GPTRouter supports multiple language and image generation models, providing fallback options so your system remains robust and versatile.

### Key Features:

- **üåê Universal API**: One API to connect them all. Easily switch between models like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Replicate, Stable Diffusion, Cohere, and more.
- **üîÄ Smart Fallbacks**: Keep your services uninterrupted. GPTRouter automatically switches to alternative models if your primary choice is unavailable.
- **üîÑ Automatic Retries**: GPTRouter intelligently retries failed requests, reducing manual effort and improving reliability.
- **‚è±Ô∏è Fast and Responsive**: Designed to reduce latency, GPTRouter ensures your interactions with AI models are quick and efficient.

## Quick Start

Ready to get started? Here's how:

---
### Prerequisites

**Getting The Server Running**
   - To run the GPTRouter server locally, follow the steps [here](https://gpt-router.writesonic.com/docs/Getting%20Started/Developing%20Locally) 
   - Alternatively, use our **Preview Deployment** with the baseURL ```https://gpt-router-preview.writesonic.com/```. Get your API key by filling out the form [here](https://gpt-router.writesonic.com/#APIKey).

---

Once the Server is running, you can integrate GPTRouter into your application using our Python SDK or via the API [Docs](https://gpt-router-preview.writesonic.com/docs/static/index.html).
Meanwhile, we are working on JS and other clients and are looking for contributors to help out.

### Using the Python SDK

Install GPTRouter using pip:
```bash
pip install gptrouter
```

Or with conda:
```bash
conda install gptrouter -c conda-forge
```


**Usage Example**
```python
from gpt_router.client import GPTRouterClient
from gpt_router.models import ModelGenerationRequest, GenerationParams
from gpt_router.enums import ModelsEnum, ProvidersEnum


client = GPTRouterClient(base_url='your_base_url', api_key='your_api_key')

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write me a short poem"},
]
prompt_params = GenerationParams(messages=messages)
claude2_request = ModelGenerationRequest(
    model_name=ModelsEnum.CLAUDE_INSTANT_12,
    provider_name=ProvidersEnum.ANTHROPIC.value,
    order=1,
    prompt_params=prompt_params,
)

response = client.generate(ordered_generation_requests=[claude2_request])
print(response.choices[0].text)
```
